        <h2 id="h_intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There have been many studies that have investigated the mitigation of corporate exposure on the web. Many of these studies
            agree that there are a variety of different problems within companies that allow corporate exposure on the web.
            (Safa, 2015) and (Ho-Jae, 2015) both agree that staff can be one of the main problems that can allow data leakage
            to occur. However both have different points of view on the reasons why staff correlate with data leakage. Other
            studies claim that negligence on security due to no factual information about the damage caused by data leakage
            can be a large problem (Ford R, 2002). While others believe not taking proper action when creating and installing
            the software for the company plays a large role with data leakage (Dunn k, 2005).</p>

        <h2>Staff and Corporate Exposure</h2>
        <p>
            One of the studies into staffs behaviour and corporate exposure suggests that even if the system itself is secure the staff
            within the corporation will still be large security risk with data exposure on the web. (Safa, 2015) “Experts
            believe that technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information. Users' behaviour should
            be considered as an important factor in this domain”. The reason that Safa suggested this statement is explained
            later on and suggests that it is within the human nature to pick up bad habits for example “Sharing their account
            information, downloading any software from the Internet, writing passwords on sticky paper, and using social
            security numbers as a username or password are examples of their mistakes.”(Safa, 2015) Safa also believes that
            planned behaviour can be factored into this problem as they reference the Theory of Planned behaviour (Icek A,
            1991) which explains that human behaviour is guided by 3 kinds of considerations, these are behavioral beliefs,
            normative beliefs and control beliefs. (Icek A, 1991) Overall Safa believes that corporations should watch over
            their staff. Another study by Ho-Jae suggests a different correlation between staff and the mitigation of data
            on the web. Ho-Jae believes that because staff can have direct access to the software and how or where the data
            is saved within the system. It allows them to do more damage than any outside damage by hackers. If they ever
            decided to rebel they could do large amounts of damage to the system “ damage due to internal information leakage
            by insiders is more serious than that by outsiders because insiders have considerable knowledge of the system’s
            identification and password (ID&P/W), the security system, and the main location of sensitive data” (Ho-Jae,
            2015) Overall Ho-Jae believes that having different level access for different staff is important for a secure
            system.

        <h2>Databases and Corporate Exposure</h2>
        <p>
            Dunn K did a study into the effects of databases and the exposure of corporate data on the web. Dunn K believes that when
            corporations create new databases they are plagued with different security flaws that could be easily fixed.
            “Databases are plagued by default configurations inherited from vendor configured installation options. When
            installing any product it can be quite difficult to foresee all of the intended functionality required.” (Dunn
            K, 2005) With this, Dunn K suggest that this can be easily fixed if the company took time when creating and/or
            installing new databases into the system. Next Dunn K also states that databases that are used within the corporation
            can have the same bugs that are in public software. Due to this hackers have already found ways of exploiting
            theses bugs which may allow the hackers to gain faster and easier access to critical information within the corporation.
            “As we know, databases are prone to critical bugs like buffer overflows in the same way that any software product
            is. When we consider the target it is easy to see how exploiting a buffer overflow within a database can give
            an attacker two prizes: control over the hosting server and access to the information protected by the database.”(Dunn
            K, 2005) With this Dunn K believes that the company should spend some time in researching the bugs that might
            be apparent within the database software before using the database. Finally Dunn K suggests that other flaws
            within the system can be features that have not been setup correctly within the database. These features contain
            safety measures that if used correctly will create a secure database however are rarely used. “Other conditions
            that are easy to exploit are those associated with well known design flaws within the database. In general, it
            is hard to patch against these issues because they represent conditions that are features of a product, that
            although can be secured through configuration, are rarely implemented within production environments. A great
            example of this is the unauthenticated querying of the Oracle TNS Listener. This can be greatly restricted by
            applying the security option ‘ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS’ and a TNS Listener password – although it is extremely rare
            to encounter this.” (Dunn K, 2005)</p>

        <h2>Damage Visualization when Data Leakage</h2>
        <p>
            Ford R & Ray H suggests that corporations are not taking action with their security as when data is leaked onto the web,
            being able to see the damage that the company took can be very difficult. “This underestimation may be due to
            some of the difficulties faced in determining actual damage. Linking a particular attack with Web-crawled data
            is difficult (if even possible) and measuring the cost of information leakage is also challenging.” They believe
            that corporations should regularly check to see if any data has been leaked as finding this early can help mitigate
            any more data leakage. “it seems reasonable that any company should engage in a regular Web content security
            audit. Once crawled information is gathered, various steps can be taken to remove or modify the offending data”
            (Ford R & Ray H, 2004) With this Ford R & Ray suggest that creating imaginary values to different data within
            the corporation can help as when the data is leaked they can have an imaginary total of how much damage has occurred.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Overall all these sources suggest that hackers have a variety of different methods to try when wanting to try and collect
            corporate information (Safa, 2015). Some of the exploits can never happen in the first place. While some can
            not have anything to do with the software itself. All the sources believe that if corporations took the correct
            steps with security corporate exposure on the web could be mitigated.</p>
